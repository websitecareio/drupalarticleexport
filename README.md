# Drupal Export
Exports drupal data to CSV for import in other systems.

## Export Users
Output user data to screen. CSV formed data, splitting with ;

All data from the two tables: users_field_data and uer__field_bio are exported.
If your tables got a prefix, you must change the table names to something different.

Any custom data in each table will be exported too. It selects all.

### How to use:
Place the file drupalExportUsers.php in your drupal root directory and open it in a browser. Save the output to a file.
